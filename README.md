CrisisWatch map
===============
This project maps Crisis Group’s CrisisWatch publication, which provides succinct updates on some 70 global conflicts on the first of each month. A jQuery datepicker allows users to view the last 12 months of CrisisWatch data. I made this primarily with leaflet.js, and the underlying map is from Mapbox. There is also a mobile version that relies on jQuery Mobile.

Crisis Group no longer supports this map. You can see an archived version [here](benjamindalton.com/public/interactives/crisiswatch).
